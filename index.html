                <h1>Countries and regions that have previously used a "dollar" currency</h1>
                <p>Confederate States of America: The Confederate States dollar issued from March 1861 to 1865 Ethiopia: The name "Ethiopian dollar" was used in the English text on the birr banknotes before the Derg takeover in 1974. Malaysia: the Malaysian
                    ringgit used to be called the "Malaysian Dollar". The surrounding territories (that is, Malaya, British North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, and Singapore) used several varieties of dollars (for example, Straits dollar, Malayan dollar, Sarawak
                    dollar, British North Borneo dollar; Malaya and British Borneo dollar) before Malaya, British North Borneo, Sarawak, Singapore and Brunei gained their independence from the United Kingdom. See also for complete list of currencies.
                    Sierra Leone: The Sierra Leonean dollar was used from 1791 to 1805. It was subdivided into 100 cents and was issued by the Sierra Leone Company. The dollar was pegged to sterling at a rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. Spain:
                    the Spanish dollar (from 1497 to 1868) is closely related to the dollars (Spanish dollar was used in USA until 1857) and euros used today. Sri Lanka; the Ceylonese rixdollar was a currency used in British Ceylon in the early 19th Century.
                    Rhodesia: the Rhodesian dollar replaced the Rhodesian pound in 1970 and it was used until Zimbabwe came into being in 1980. Republic of Texas: the Texas dollar was issued between January 1839 and September 1840. Zimbabwe: once used
                    the Zimbabwe dollar, but abolished it and now uses the South African rand, the US dollar,[9] the Euro, the Pound sterling, the Botswana pula, the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen.[10]</p>

                <h1>Egyptian pound
                </h1>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 1834, a khedival decree was issued, adopting an Egyptian currency based on a bimetallic standard (gold and silver) on the basis of the Maria Theresa thaler, a popular trade coin in the region.[7] The Egyptian pound, known as the geneih,
                    was introduced, replacing the Egyptian piastre (ersh) as the chief unit of currency. The piastre continued to circulate as 1⁄100 of a pound, with the piastre subdivided into 40 para. In 1885, the para ceased to be issued, and the piastre
                    was divided into tenths (عشر القرش 'oshr el-ersh). These tenths were renamed milliemes (malleem) in 1916. The legal exchange rates were fixed by force of law for important foreign currencies which became acceptable in the settlement
                    of internal transactions. Eventually this led to Egypt using a de facto gold standard between 1885 and 1914, with LE 1 = 7.4375 grams pure gold. At the outbreak of World War I, the Egyptian pound used a peg of one Egyptian pound to
                    one pound and sixpence sterling (£1 = LE 0.975, or 92 1 / 2 PT). Egypt remained part of the Sterling Area until 1962, when Egypt devalued slightly and switched to a peg to the United States dollar, at a rate of LE 1 = US$2.3. This
                    peg was changed to LE 1 = US$2.55555 in 1973 when the dollar was devalued. The Egyptian pound floated in 1989. However, until 2001, the float was tightly managed by the Central Bank of Egypt and foreign exchange controls were in effect.
                    After exhausting all of its policies to support its pound, the Central Bank of Egypt was forced to end the managed-float regime and allowed the Egyptian pound to float freely on the 3rd of November 2016;[8] the bank also announced
                    an end to foreign exchange controls that day.[9] The official rate fell twofold. The Egyptian pound was also used in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan between 1899 and 1956, and Cyrenaica when it was under British occupation and later an independent
                    emirate between 1942 and 1951. It also circulated in Mandatory Palestine from 1918 to 1927, when the Palestine pound was introduced, equal in value to sterling. The National Bank of Egypt issued banknotes for the first time on 3 April
                    1899. The Central Bank of Egypt and the National Bank of Egypt were unified into the Central Bank of Egypt in 1961. </p>
